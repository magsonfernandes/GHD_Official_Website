Along the Arabian Sea, daily catch becomes coconut-rich curries, crisp fish fries, fragrant Xacuti, sharp Balchão, and the quiet refreshment of Solkadhi — a cuisine shaped by Konkan traditions and Portuguese influence, still evolving at the table.",

Expect fish curry and fish fry alongside deeper preparations such as Xacuti and Balchão, often balanced with Solkadhi and the accompaniments of a traditional thali.",
